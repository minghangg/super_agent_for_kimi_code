"""Delivery markers: ``[WK:<name>]`` on the **first non-empty line** only.

``gh_issue.py comment`` prefixes every worker comment with
``[WK:<worker-name>] ``. That prefix is how the engine recognises a delivery,
so parsing has to be precise in two ways:

* **only the first non-empty line is a marker.** A comment that *quotes* a
  delivery (``see [WK:foo] above``) is discussion, not a delivery; scanning the
  whole body would turn every quotation into a second delivery.
* the name is the worker's session key, so it is compared verbatim (after
  stripping). A marker that does not match a live worker falls back to "the
  only live worker on this thread" in the caller, never to a guess.

Legacy behaviour is unchanged: a comment without a marker is handed back to the
keyword triage exactly as before.
